In this unit, I learned a lot about web design. Reviewing the Design Thinking Process helped me understand how to approach projects better. Adding and styling links was new and fun. I struggled a bit with some code challenges but overcame them through practice. Gathering client feedback made me realize the importance of others' opinions. It's been a great learning experience, and I'm excited to keep improving my web design skills.
