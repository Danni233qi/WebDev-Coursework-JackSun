This unit on web design was really eye - opening. Learning about the United Nations Global Goals made me realize the bigger purpose behind web projects. Applying design thinking was both challenging and rewarding. I had fun with the code challenge, even though it was a bit tough at times. It taught me the importance of problem - solving and creating useful websites.
