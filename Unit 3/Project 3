Going through this unit, I've learned a lot about client web page projects. Figuring out how to choose a client and looking at sample profiles was really helpful. The lessons on interviewing clients made me realize how important it is to know what clients want. I now understand the basic steps better. It's been a great learning experience, and I'm excited to use these skills in future projects.
