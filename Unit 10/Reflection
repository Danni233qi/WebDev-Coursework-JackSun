Unit 10 was really interesting but also a bit hard for me. When I tried to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together in the code challenges, I got confused. Like when making the navigation bar, I didn't know how to make it look good and work right. I asked my classmates for help and looked at my notes again. And learning those web design principles was cool. I didn't know things like visual hierarchy were so important. Now I can use these ideas to make my websites better
