In Unit 5, learning CSS brought both fun and challenges. At first, memorizing what CSS is and its importance was really hard. Basic properties like font size and color confused me regarding the proper values, while is different between inline, internal, and external CSS was extremely difficult. However, by practicing and asking my classmates for help, I finally understood these concepts, and now feel more confident in using CSS for web design.
