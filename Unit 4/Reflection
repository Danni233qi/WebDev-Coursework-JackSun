In Unit 4, learning HTML styling was tough. Remembering different attributes was confusing. When I got confused, I asked my classmates for help. They explained things clearly and showed me some easy ways to remember. Understanding the differences between ordered and unordered lists also took time. I had to make many examples to figure it out. Add images and getting the sizing right was another big trouble. But with the help of my classmates and lots of practice, I finally understood everything.
